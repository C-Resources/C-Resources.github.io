# C Resources

For people coming to the C language for the first time, we have
[learning resources](learning) suitable for first-time programmers and
for programmers with experience in other languages.

For people who can already program in C, we also have useful
information: reference material, skills development material, pointers
to other resources, standards documents, and information about tools
for use with the C language.
