# C Resources

For people coming to the C language for the first time, I have
[learning resources](learning/index.md) suitable for first-time
programmers and for programmers with experience in other languages.

For people who can already program in C, I also have information about
ways to build skills by [practice](practice.md).

Soon I will add some additional material

* Information about the C Standard itself
* Information about C programming tools
