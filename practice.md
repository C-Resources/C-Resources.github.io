# Practice

Here are some resources for practicing C skills (mostly for those who
already know the language).  These might be useful for beginners
building skills or for experienced programmers who want to sharpen
their skills or who simply want project ideas.

## Practice Exercises

Most of these exercises come with a way to check your answer.

* [Computer Science by Example](https://cscx.org/)
   * Although some of these exercises are suitable for beginners,
     there are also some "bonus exercises" that more advanced
     programmers might find useful.
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c)
   * Lots of people like this.  However, *use with caution* as some of
     the code you will see exhibits poor habits (e.g. not checking for
     errors).
   * If you are going to use these, consider pairing them with a
     teaching resource with a strong focus on correctness and good
     habits.  Such as *Effective C* (see [Books Suitable for
     Programming
     Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/wiki/index/learning#wiki_books_suitable_for_programming_beginners)).
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - Christmas-themed
  puzzles.  New puzzles each December.  Within each year's exercises,
  the first ones are relatively easy and the later ones get very hard
  (requiring significant Data Structures & Algorithms skills, often
  from about day 16).  Created by Eric Wastl.
* [Synacor Challenge](https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge) -
  also created by Eric Wastl.
   * The original page is gone now, but the above URL provides all the things you will need.
   * The challenge is to build an emulator for a computer described in
     the instructions, and then use it to run an example program
     ... which presents additional challenges.
   * Caveat: there are lots of spoilers for this on the web
* [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org)
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - mathematically focused
  puzzles with graduated difficulty
* Online Judge systems
   * These provide questions and will automatically tell you if your solution is correct.
   * There is a list of these at https://code.fandom.com/wiki/Online_judge
* Code Kata Collections
    * http://codekata.com/ - puzzles, but no solutions are provided
    * [List of Katas](https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas) by Gabe Montalvo


## Project Ideas

These generally won't come with solutions.

* General Stuff
   * https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/
   * Lists of projects ideas
      * https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/
      * [Peymaan Abedinpour: 150 Brilliant Programming Ideas: Projects to Spark Your Coding Journey](https://medium.com/@peymaan.abedinpour/150-brilliant-programming-ideas-projects-to-spark-your-coding-journey-cbc1c106819d)
* Topics
   * Graphics
      * [Ray Tracing in One
        Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
        (actually uses C++ but you can probably convert the examples
        to C)

## Things to Stay Away From

Here are some anti-recommendations of learning resources I do not
recommend you use, each with a brief explanation.

* codeforwin.org
   * The model answers have some significant style problems.  Our
     concern is that you would learn counterproductive habits by
     learning from these.
* https://github.com/manjunath5496/Beginner-C-Exercises
   * Model answers exhibit sloppy habits and lack any useful
     indentation
* www.placementpreparation.io
   * Solution judge rejects answers for very early exercises that are
     close enough to correct (e.g. too many decimal places in
     floating-point answers)
   * Solutions sometimes look garbled due to character encoding
     issues.
* www.scribd.com/document/876660790/30-Beginner-C-Programming-Exercises-With-Solutions
   * More bad habits.  Some solutions (e.g. GCD) could benefit from
     commentary or explanation but don't have them.
* https://www.learn-c.org/
   * This is actually not quite as bad as other other sites listed
     here but it does have some problems.  Specifically, corectness
     issues (e.g. printing pointers with %x) and it's slightly out of
     date (e.g. claims C has no boolean type).

## Things We'd Like a Review of

Here are some resources Ihaven't evaluated yet and so haven't been
able to put them in the "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" sections.
If you have an opionion (and can explain why) please let me know.

* [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
* [onlinejudge.org](https://onlinejudge.org) - is C supported?
* Meta
   * https://judge0.com/ - this is a platform, but maybe some of its
     users have good challenges.
