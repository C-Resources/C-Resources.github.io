# Learning C for Experienced Programmers

These books either assume you are already able to program in some
other language, or at least don't claim to be accessible by beginners.

## Printed Books

*[The C Programming
Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131103628)* by Dennis
M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan, second edition, covering ISO
("ANSI") Standard C. This book was written by the language's creator,
and it is known colloquially as "K & R".

## Books Also Available Online

These books are available as a printed book and also for free online.
None of these has nearly the stature of K&R, but on the other hand
they may be more practical for some readers due to being available
online.
