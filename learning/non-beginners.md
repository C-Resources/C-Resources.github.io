# Learning C for Experienced Programmers

These books either assume you are already able to program in some
other language, or at least don't claim to be accessible by beginners.

## Printed Books

### The C Programming Language

*[The C Programming
Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131103628)* by Dennis
M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan is the "orignal" book on the
language and it is known colloquially as "K & R".

This book has a lot of advantages:
* Written by the language creator
* Reasonably short (less than 270 pages); this makes it easier to find
  things.
* Translated into many languages

[Brian Kernighan's page about the K&R
book](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/cbook.html) lists some
translations and provides some additional information. [Dennis
Ritchie's page at Bell
Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/dennis-m-ritchie/)
contains information about the origins of the C language, its history,
and points to an [archived page about the K&R
book](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/belllabs-microsite-dritchie/cbook/index.html).

## Books Also Available Online

These books are available as a printed book and also for free online.
None of these has nearly the stature of K&R, but on the other hand
they may be more practical for some readers due to being available
online.
