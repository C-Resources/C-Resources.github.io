# Learning Resources

## Resources for Those Unfamiliar with C

For those who are new to C, we have pages which suggest ways to learn
and resources to use:

* [Learning C for Programming Beginners](beginners.md)
* [Learning C for Experienced Programmers](non-beginners.md)

## Learning Resources for C Programmers

This pages focuses on books, podcasts and other content for C
programmers.  Many people find that they learn best by "learning by
doing", and so you might find the [resources for
practice](practice.md) page useful.

## Other Books
* [The Standard C Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/532092) by P. J. Plauger
* C: A Reference Manual, by Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele

## Tutorials on the C Language

* Beginners Mistakes
   * Trying to learn C by using tutorials can present problems; see
     [Learning C for Programming Beginners](beginners.md) for
     an explanation and some alternative approaches.
   * [A beginners' guide away from
     scanf()](https://sekrit.de/webdocs/c/beginners-guide-away-from-scanf.html)
* The C Language
   * beej's guides
      * Beej's Guide to Network Programming (see below) is
        well-regarded, but they have also written these.
      * [Beej's guide to C programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/)
      * [Beej's Guide to C Programming â€” Library Reference](https://beej.us/guide/bgclr/)
   * [A Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in
     C](https://github.com/jflaherty/ptrtut13)


## Tutorials on Specific Topics

* Floating-Point Arithmetic
   * [What every computer scientist should know about floating-point
     arithmetic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/103162.103163) by
     David Goldberg ([Computing Surveys, March
     1991](https://dl.acm.org/toc/csur/1991/23/1)).
* Network Programming
   * The well-known and highly regarded [Beej's Guide to Network
     Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) ([also available in
     paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1705309909))
      * If you're unfamiliar with networking, you might find [Beej's
        Guide to Networking Concepts](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet0/)
        useful, though it uses Python as a teaching tool.
   * [Beej's Guide to Unix Interprocess Communication](https://beej.us/guide/bgipc/)
