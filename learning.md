# Learning Resources

This page points to learning resources for beginners and
non-beginners.  The resources here are mostly things that you read,
listen to, watch, and so on. A lot of people find that they learn best
by applying the things that they are learning.  If that is you, we
still recommend using a book or a course to begin your learning, but
you might also find our page about [resources for
practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/wiki/index/learning/practice)
useful.

When learning C, beginners should probably read a lot more code than
they write (and to be sure this reflects what professional programmers
usually do).  However, many teaching environments don't feature a lot
of reading code, and we don't yet have a "recommended reading list" of
good C code.

## Books Suitable for Programming Beginners

* [*C Programming: A Modern
  Approach*](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) by K N King
* *[Effective C](http://robertseacord.com/wp/)* by Robert C. Seacord
   * The book doesn't assume you can already program.  It is very
     careful to only teach correct ideas, without simplifying or
     "dumbing down".  If you can learn C from this book, you will come
     out of it with fewer misconceptions that might be the case with
     some other books.  On the other hand, other books might provide a
     gentler learning curve (to illustrate, *Effective C* introduces
     the concept of Undefined Behaviour on page 10).
* Often recommended in the past but perhaps not recently: *C: How to
  Program*, 2nd Ed., Deitel, H.M. & Deitel, P.J.


Although it is not strictly a book, a lot of people find that
Harvard's
[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
(Harvard's introduction to computer science with a C programming
course) is very good.

## Books Suitable for Experienced Programmers

These books either assume you are already able to program in some
other language, or at least don't claim to be accessible by beginners.

* Literal paper books:

## Tutorials on Specific Topics

* Beginners Mistakes
   * Videos
      * Trying to learn to program by watching video tutorials can
        often put beginners in "Tutorial Hell" where they watch a lot
        of content but come out of still not having a great
        understanding.  See [What exactly is tutorial
        hell?](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/188ated/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/)
        for some opinions on the problem.
