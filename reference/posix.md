# POSIX

The POSIX Standard is also known as IEEE Std 1003.1.  That is, it is
published by the IEEE as a standard.  The POSIX standard defines what
systems have to do to be called "Unix" and the API it specifies forms
a large part of the interface between applications for Linux or Unix
(including Mac OS X) and the system on which they run.  The POSIX
standard is identically the same thing as "The Open Group Technical
Base Specifications".  Updates to the Standard are developed by The
Open Group.  The POSIX Standard is one of the components ot The Single
Unix Specification.

The POSIX Standard did exist before 1997.  It comprised several
separate parts (POSIX.1, POSIX.1b, POSIX.1c, POSIX.2).  In 1999, IEEE
and The Open Group agreed to share copyright in the standard and that
The Open Group would provide the committee chair and secretariat.
